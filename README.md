## :mag: Exploration and Analysis

First, let's understand the distribution of the passengers.

- **Gender:**
- **Age:**

and so on...


After gaining an initial understanding of the dataset and the problem statement, I've some guiding questions in mind to begin the analysis. These questions take us in the right direction to solve the issue in hand. I try to answer these questions through vizualisations on Tableau.

**1. What percentage of the passengers are overall satisfied with the Airline?**

- As we can see above, only **43%** of the passengers are satisfied with the airline. The majority **57%** are either neutral or dissatisfied.


**2. Which customer segments are dissatisfied with the Airline? (Based on Gender, Age, Customer Type, Type of Travel, Class and Flight Distance)**

- **Gender**

|Female|Male|
|----|----|

- Thus, the percentage of female passengers satisfied with the airline is almost the same as that of males.

- **Age group**

- Age group 31-59 has the highest percentage of satisfied customers i.e. 53% which is greater than the overall percentage of satisfied customers.
- Under 18 and 60 & above have a very high percentage of dissatisfied customers i.e. 83% and 79% respectively.
